# FriendFinder

This is the friend finding app(similar to dating app). We use node.js and require express, body-parser, and path in order to properly connect routes between the entire application.

After the participant takes the survey the app adds up all of there scores and compares it to the scores of a potential friend with the most similar score.

This app is also deployed on heroku!(Will be changing the name of the heroku link off of the random preset name it gave me later)
